This should *not* be used as a tutorial for Java game development or as example code for writing games.  I have never made a game before and am doing this without a tutorial or any outside help.  That being the case, I wouldn't be comfortable saying that any of the code follows the best coding practices for writing a game. It is merely a project that I'm using to keep myself entertained.
